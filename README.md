# [WIP] RedShark
It is a "simple" youtube client.

# How it works
It uses [YuruVerse API](https://funami.tech) to search throw youtube.
After opening video it uses [mpv](https://mpv.io) with [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to watch it.

# FAQ
## Why did you start another youtube client project when there are plenty of them?
I wanted to check the current state of vala language, also no project suit me for my use or was not [WIP](https://dont-ship.it/).

...but I use some code from this one [Replay](https://github.com/nahuelwexd/Replay), without it, I wouldn't start this project.

# TODO
* create icon 
* play multiple video at once
* support youtube alternatives

# Build From Source
